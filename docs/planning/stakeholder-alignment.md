# Stakeholder Alignment Plan

This plan tracks the cross-functional decisions that require collaboration between design, data, and engineering leaders before implementation proceeds.

## Upcoming Alignment Sessions

| Accessibility theme validation | [SG-010](backlog.md#sg-010-validate-theme-colors-for-accessibility) | Product Design, Accessibility Consultant, Mobile Lead | Run contrast checks, collect real device screenshots, summarize adjustments needed for WCAG AA. | 2024-05-03 | Approval required before theming tokens are frozen. |

## Coordination Checklist

- Share pre-work artifacts 48 hours before each session.
- Capture decisions and rationale in meeting notes linked from the relevant backlog issues.
- Update backlog item status immediately after alignment to unblock downstream tasks.
- Revisit schedule weekly to add new decisions that span design and data ownership.
